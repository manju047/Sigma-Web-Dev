# What is a data type ?
""" Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds. This is required in programming to do various operations without causing an error."""

# 1. Numeric data: int, float, complex
# 2. Text data: str
# 3. Boolean data:True & False ("T & F should be capital")
# 4. Sequenced data: list, tuple
# 5. Mapped data: dict
