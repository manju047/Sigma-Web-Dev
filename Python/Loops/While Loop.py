# While Loop
""" While:while loops execute statements while the condition is True. As soon as the condition becomes False, the interpreter comes out of the while loop. 
while is also known as entry-controlled loop i.e first the condition is checked and then the block of code is executed if the condiotion is false then it jumps out of the block

Steps to be followed while printing the loop
1.intialization of the variable 
2. block of statements to be executed
3.increment / decrement operation      
          """

# i = 0
# while(i<5):
#     print(i)
#     i=i+1
# print("out of the loop")

# i=0
# num = int(input("enter the number"))
# while(i<num):
#     print(i)
#     i=i+1
# print("out of the loop")


# decrementing the values

# count=5
# # count = int(input("enter the number"))
# while (count > 0):
#   print(count)
#   count = count - 1

# Else with While Loop
"""We can even use the else statement with the while loop. Essentially what the else statement does is that as soon as the while loop condition becomes False, the control comes out of the while loop and the else statement is executed.
~  intially it checks the condition of the while loop if the condition is true then the body of while is exuected if condition become false then it executes the body of else 
"""

# x = int(input("enter the number Greater than 0  : "))
# while (x > 0):
#     print(x)
#     x = x - 1
# else:
#     print('Please enter a positive number')

# Do-While loop in python
"""do..while is a loop in which a set of instructions will execute at least once (irrespective of the condition) and then the repetition of loop's body will depend on the condition passed at the end of the while loop. It is also known as an exit-controlled loop."""

# do{

# set of instructions / body 

# }while(condition)
