# Difference between "is" & "==" 
"""
==> In python is both 'is' and '==' operators are used to check if two values are equal or not.
==> The 'is' operator is used to check the identity (address of values or reference of the value)of the two objects. 
==> While the '==' operator is used to check the values of the objects.
==> This means that 'is' will only return True if the objects being compared are the "exact same object in memory", while '==' will return True if the objects "have the same value"
==> For mutable objects such as lists and dictionaries. 'is' and '==' can behave differently. In general, you should use '==' when you want to compare the values of two objects, and use is when you want to check if two objects are the same object in memory.

"""
Conclusion : 

==> To get a clear overview use the id(var_name) fucntion which returns the memory-referernce/address of the varaible.

==> If we compare the values of the "mutable objects" (list , dictionary and etc..) then the 'is' operator will "return false" and '==' operator will "retrun true.

==> If we compare the values of the "immutable objects" then the "both is and == operator will return true".  
==> when we assign the same values in the immutable objects then it stores the values in the same memory location and doesnot creates the another copies of the values."
